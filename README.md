# Customer Segmentation With K-NN
**Project: Customer Segmentation with K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm**

This project aims to segment customers in the teleCust1000T dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project involves data visualization, feature analysis, model training and evaluation, and identification of the optimal number of neighbors for KNN.

### Data and Libraries
The project utilizes the following:

* **Data:** `teleCust1000T.csv` containing information about customers, such as tenure, age, income, and customer category.
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
```

### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Import and Exploration:** Reads the CSV data, analyzes data distribution, and identifies potential outliers.

2. **Feature Selection:** Selects relevant features for the KNN model.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizes numeric features and encodes categorical features.

4. **Train-Test Split:** Divides data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

5. **KNN Model Training:** Trains a KNN model with different values of K.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of trained models using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

7. **Finding Optimal K:** Identifies the optimal number of neighbors for KNN based on model performance.

8. **Visualization:** Plots data distributions, accuracy curves, and confusion matrices for different K values.

9. **Results and Conclusion:** Summarizes key findings and interpretations of the KNN model's performance.

### Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prometheussx/knn-customer-segmentation.git
cd knn-customer-segmentation
```
   

### Key Results

* The implemented KNN model achieved a best accuracy of [accuracy value]% with [optimal K value] neighbors.
* The model was able to successfully identify patterns and segment customers into different categories based on their features.
* The results demonstrate the effectiveness of KNN for customer segmentation and provide valuable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

### Future Work

* This project can be extended by incorporating additional features and exploring other machine learning algorithms for customer segmentation.
* Further analysis could be done to understand the influence of individual features on customer segmentation and develop explainable models.
* The model could be integrated into a real-world application for customer targeting and personalized recommendations.

### Images

The README.md file includes images to visualize data distributions, accuracy curves, and confusion matrices for different K values. This enhances the understanding of the project's results and provides visual aids for interpreting the KNN model's performance.
